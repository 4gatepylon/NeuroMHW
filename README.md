# Things that could be cool
1. Create a go-to-market strategy with customer segments, a story (pain points plus persona), etcetera.
2. Create a brochure with our go-to-market strategy as well as financials of the product and expected revenue plus a valuation. We can try to hand these out at the main event.
3. Get pictures of models using our app (or maybe we just take pictures of ourselves looking cool) and create a very nice site with these people to show the look.
